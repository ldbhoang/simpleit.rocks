# Use a Ruby build container
# i.e. give script access to Bundler, RubyGems, and a Ruby runtime.
language: ruby

# Ruby Version Manager
# This directive tells Travis the Ruby version to use when running
# the test script.
rvm:
- 2.3.1

# The build script file needs to have the executable attribute set or
# Travis will fail with a permission denied error
before_script:
 - npm install -g bower
 - bower install
 - chmod +x ./script/cibuild.sh # or do this locally and commit

# Assume bundler is being used, therefore
# the `install` step will run `bundle install` by default.
## install: gem install jekyll html-proofer
script: ./script/cibuild.sh

# branch whitelist, only for GitHub Pages
# Travis will build from every push to any branch of your repo if
# branches directive isn't present.
# branches:
#   only:
#   - gh-pages     # test the gh-pages branch
#   - /pages-(.*)/ # test every branch which starts with "pages-"

env:
  global:
  - NOKOGIRI_USE_SYSTEM_LIBRARIES=true # speeds up installation of html-proofer

# This command explicitly tells Travis to run your build on Travisâ€™s
# container-based infrastructure.
sudo: false # route your build to the container-based infrastructure for a faster build
