I am [Marcelo Canina](http://marcanuy.com), a web entrepreneur from 
[Uruguay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay).

## Story

I enjoy all aspects of designing a web application, from web server 
administration, to design, code and front end designing of apps.

When in the process of creating a new project, I found myself referring
often to the same documentation I've read relatively long time ago and
struggling to remember the basic aspects of each technology, trying to
find some old Stack Overflow's question I know I have read in the past
that would be helpful in what I am doing now.

Main problem was that I often ended up reading different sources for same
concepts, wasting time and not helpful to remember them in the future.

This website started as a set of docs where I started centralizing several
notes about the _urls_ and concepts I found helpful enough to have, then I
started to write them publicly as a section in my
[personal website](http://marcanuy.com) where I used to collect my own notes
about tech topics to have them as a quick reference for future projects.

Learning is a personal experience where you expand your knowledge based on
what you knew before, **I highly encourage any developer to start writing
down their own notes while coding**, not simply relying in third party
documentation, this is what I found most helpful to learn more and 
__consolidating new concepts__.

## Website goals

This website aims to:

- Act as a centralized place to have as reference and lookup stuff 
  quickly while developing.

- Have a uniform, clear way of having documentation for several 
  technologies instead of depending on each different documentation
  system and style.
  
- Sharing experience and knowledge in a clear, concise way.

- Practicing English, my mother tongue is Spanish so any comments about any
  error in spelling is more than welcome.

## Colophon

The website is powered by **Jekyll**, and its code is freely available at 
Github pages.

Each category has all the sub-posts that belong to that category, this is 
what I found more helpful when dealing with a specific technology so I
can look up fast any concept or special syntax belonging to a particular
language.

## Conventions

- _tags_ should be in __plural__ form.
