# Concepts

> Jekyll is, at its core, a text transformation engine. 
> The concept behind the system is this: you give it text written in your
> favorite markup language, be that Markdown, Textile, or just plain HTML, 
> and it churns that through a layout or a series of layout files. 
> Throughout that process you can tweak how you want the site URLs to look, 
> what data gets displayed in the layout, and more.

## Front Matter ##

The [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) is the piece of code that tell Jekyll to process a page or post in a special way, where you can change the _layout_, _language_ or more configurations that if not specified they just took the default settings of _config.yml_.
. 

e.g.:

```
---
layout: post
title: My cool blog
---
```

It has two requirements:

+ It must be at the beginning of the file
+ It must be in [YAML](http://yaml.org/) format

## Posts formatting syntax ##

The most common formatting syntax used in posts and pages are:

+ Markdown <https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>
+ [kramdown]({% post_url /en/notes/2016-05-31-kramdown %}) (a more powerful Markdown superset and currently used in _Github pages_)

### Syntax highlighting

By default Jekyll uses [Rouge](https://github.com/jneen/rouge) as its syntax highlter and is compatible with [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) highlighter. 

## Templating system ##

Jekyll uses the __Liquid__ template engine: <https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers>
