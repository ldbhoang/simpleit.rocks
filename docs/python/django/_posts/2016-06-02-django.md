# Concepts

Fat models, thin views.

Each Django _project_ can be composed of many _apps_. An _app_ is a small project that should focus on performing one task (e.g. A website project can have: a blog, ratings, news apps).

# Django project structure

[Two Scoops Of Django] recommends the following structure: ( implemented in [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django))

~~~
̃ /.virtualenvs/<django_project_name>/    #keep venv outside project structure
...
<repository_root>/ #git repo
    README.rst
	docs/
	.gitignore
	requirements/
		base.txt
		local.txt
		production.txt
		test.txt
	Makefile - Deployment tasks
    <django_project_root>/
	    manage.py
		media/ #only in development, user generated static media assets (e.g. photos)
		static/ #non user generated static media assets (e.g. css)
		        #controlled by STATICFILES DIRS config variable
		templates/ # site-wide templates
		<an_app>/
        <configuration_root>/
			__init.py__
			settings/
				__init.py__
				base.py
				local.py
				production.py
			urls.py
			wsgi.py
~~~

__Media__ and __static__ directories in production should be located in a static media server.

# Configuration and environment isolation

Every config file should be version controlled, even the developers local configuration, all the developers of a project should use the same development configuration. 

However there are special config keys that should be left out of versioning, like the SECRET_KEY setting (used for [cryptographic signing functionalities](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/signing/))

The default _Config file_ that comes shipped with Django should be pulled apart into several settings for each environment: _local_, _staging_, _test_, _production_. This can be done easily inheriting from a _base config file_, changing what the specific environment needs and __[leaving secret keys outside config files versioning using environment variables](http://12factor.net/config)__.

If _virtualenvwrapper_ is being used, the default development settings parameter to work with _manage.py_ can be specified in the _postactivate_ hook: `echo "export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=settings.local" >> $VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/postactivate`

When using _manage.py_ many commands accepts the parameter to specify a specific settings file: `python manage.py runserver --settings=myproject.settings.local`

+ To compare the current settings file with the one that installs Django by default: `$ manage.py diffsettings`

## Setting environment variables

In a __development__ environment, variables can be set with `$ export A_SECRET_KEY=shhh1234`, and placed in:

+ _.bashrc_ or _.profile_ 
+ _virtualenvwrapper's_ __bin/activate__ hook file

To check that the secret environment key is being loaded, it is possibleto check it from a python shell:

``` python
import os
os.environ["A_SECRET_KEY"]
"shhh1234"
```

Then to get the value for a specific environment, the _production config file_ in version control only needs to get this environment variable value: `A_SECRET_KEY = os.environ["A_SECRET_KEY"]`

In a __production__ environment like [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars), this can be done with: `$ heroku config:set A_SECRET_KEY=shhh1234`

## Splitting the default Django's settings file into several files for different environments

Django automatically creates a configuration file in `<project_name>/settings.py`, to break it up into _local_, _testing_, _staging_ and _production_ config files, the best way is to create a `base.py` config with common configurations accross all of them and leave:

1. Create the settings directory `$ mkdir <project_name>/settings`
2. Add `__init__.py` file to make Python treat the settings directory as containing packages `$ touch <project_name>/settings/__init__.py`
3. Move the default settings file into the settings directory and change its name `$ mv <project_name>/settings.py <project_name>/settings/base.py`
4. Create all the configuration files (_local.py_, _testing.py_, _staging_, _production_ )and specify to inherit _base.py_ configurations, for example, for the development file: `echo "from .base import *" >> <project_name>/settings/local.py`
5. Configure the current environment to use the appropriate settings file, in development: `$ export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=mysite.settings.local`

Django has two administrative scripts: __django_admin.py__ and __manage.py__ (that automatically configures the django instance with the current project). 
One of the [differences](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/django-admin/) between them is that _manage.py_ automatically configures the  __DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE__ environment variable using the project's _settings.py_.

> Generally, when working on a single Django project, it’s easier to use manage.py than django-admin. 
> If you need to switch between multiple Django settings files, use django-admin with DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE or the --settings command line option.

## Packages for each environment

Each environment needs a specific requirements file, having a _base.txt_ requirement file with common packages across environments and then adding the needed packages for each environment.

Common commands:

+ To make it possible for each environment to inherit the packages from the _base.txt_ requirement file, each new file should begin with: `-r base.txt`
+ To generate a requirements file: [$ pip freeze](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_freeze/) `$ pip freeze --local > requirements/base.txt` 
+ To install the requirements file in a local environment: `$ pip install -r requirements/base.txt`

## Models 

## View

* Generic views <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/class-based-views/generic-display/>

* Model forms <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/forms/modelforms/>

## Testing

* <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/testing/>
* Assertions available are from _unittest_ and from Django's _TestCase_ so the full list of _assertions_ available are:
    * <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/testing/tools/#assertions>
	* <https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#assert-methods>

> The preferred way to write tests in Django is using the [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#module-unittest) module built in to the Python standard library
{: cite="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/testing/"}

> In Django we subclasses from django.test.TestCase, which is a subclass of unittest.TestCase that runs each test inside a transaction to provide isolation.
{: cite="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/testing/overview/"}

> Django provides a [test Client](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/intro/tutorial05/#the-django-test-client) to simulate a user interacting with the code at the view level. We can use it in tests.py
