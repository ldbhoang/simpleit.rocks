## Object Oriented concepts in Python

> The rule of thumb is, don't introduce a new attribute outside of the __init__ method, otherwise you've given the caller an object that isn't fully initialized.

* Why you need _self_ as the first positional argument of a method

> In Python, this: `my_object.method("foo")` is syntactic sugar, which the interpreter translates behind the scenes into: `MyClass.method(my_object, "foo")` which, as you can see, does indeed have two arguments - it's just that the first one is implicit, from the point of view of the caller. 
> This is because most methods do some work with the object they're called on, so there needs to be some way for that object to be referred to inside the method. By convention, this first argument is called self inside the method definition.

## Environment isolation

### Same database engine in all the environments

The same database engine (e.g. PostgreSQL, sqlite, MySQL), should be used in all the different environments of a project.

It is a common bad practice to have a lightweight database in the _development_ environment and something more powerful in _production_, all of them should use the same engine to avoid the different ways each one handle the data.

This way it is possible to:

+ examine the _production environment_ data locally.
+ avoid the different _types_ and _constraints_ each database engine has. (e.g. sqlite does not support foreign key constraint, while PostgreSQL does )

### Project packages ###

Project environment isolation with __pip__ and __virtualenv__ is recommended, so each project can handle their own dependencies and language versions.

### OS isolation ###

If there is more than one computer in the development process, there would be probably different Operating Systems and software versions involved that can lead to inconsistencies in source code. There are two applications that play nice together:

+ [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) creates reproducible development environments. In addition to being useful in setting up _developers environments_, it makes easier to configure __development__, __staging__ and __production__ environment.

+ [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) is a virtualization product, makes it easy to have the same OS that the Vagrant file is built for.
