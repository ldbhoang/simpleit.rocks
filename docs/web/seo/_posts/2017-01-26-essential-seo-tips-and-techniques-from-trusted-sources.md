## Facts

### Android

Apps are favored on search results made from Android devices.

> App Indexing, when indexed content from your app is relevant to a
> search done on Google on Android devices, people may start to see app
> install buttons for your app in search results. we are starting to use
> App Indexing as a ranking signal for all users on Android, regardless

### Crawling

Crawling rate is not a ranking signal.

> Google uses hundreds of signals to rank the results, and while
> crawling is necessary for being in the results, it's not a ranking
> signal.

### HTTPS

HTTPS is a ranking signal and is better than HTTP.

> we're starting to use HTTPS as a ranking signal. For now it's only a
> very lightweight signal — affecting fewer than 1% of global queries,
> and carrying less weight than other signals such as high-quality
> content — while we give webmasters time to switch to HTTPS. But over
> time, we may decide to strengthen it, because we’d like to encourage
> all website owners to switch from HTTP to HTTPS to keep everyone
> safe on the web.

### Inbound Links

Links from other websites should be gained through:

- merit-based and
- freely-volunteered 
- relevant to geographic location

> Inbound links are links from pages on external sites linking back to
> your site. Inbound links can bring new users to your site, and when
> the links are merit-based and freely-volunteered as an editorial
> choice, they're also one of the positive signals to Google about
> your site's importance. Other signals include things like our
> analysis of your site's content, its relevance to a geographic
> location, etc

### Content

Search query intent is favored over a mobile friendly site, i.e.: a
non mobile-friendly site with better content than a mobile friendly
one with less relevant content will be preferred.

> the intent of the search query is still a very strong signal — so
> even if a page with high quality content is not mobile-friendly, it
> could still rank well if it has great, relevant content.

> readable without tapping or zooming, tap targets are spaced
> appropriately, and the page avoids unplayable content or horizontal
> scrolling.

### Social

Google +1 button amount of shares may increase web pages ranking.

> We’ll add +1 buttons to search results and ads on Google.com. We’ll
> also start to look at +1’s as one of the many signals we use to
> determine a page’s relevance and ranking, including social signals
> from other services. For +1's, as with any new ranking signal, we'll
> be starting carefully and learning how those signals affect search
> quality over time.

> our products and on the web. As part of that effort, today we're
