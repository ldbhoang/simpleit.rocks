> Google's algorithms rely on more than 200 unique signals or "clues"
> that make it possible to surface what you might be looking
> for. These signals include things like the specific words that
> appear on websites, the freshness of content, your region and
> PageRank.

## Facts

### Lengths

In Search Engine Result Pages Googles shows (for desktop):

- Title: 69 chararcters.
- Meta Description: 324 characters.
- URLs: 84 characters.

### URL Structure

Number of levels in the URL doesn't affect page's ranking. Thinking in
terms of pagerank, if a page is linked from root it will get more
pagerank, no matter how many levels is that page in. But structuring
content in levels would make a difference in usability.

> But saying there is one or two extra directories therefor your
> rankings get lower I wouldn't worry about that at all, that is
> really not a major factor in Google search engine ranking.

{: class="blockquote" cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_A1iRY6XTM"}

> Google historically doesn't worry so much about how deep a set of
> directories is. **If you have your root page, and you link directly to a
> very deep page that page would still get the page rank from root
> page**. I would go with the path just for user experience.

### Android

Apps are favored on search results made from Android devices.

> App Indexing, when indexed content from your app is relevant to a
> search done on Google on Android devices, people may start to see app
> install buttons for your app in search results. we are starting to use
> App Indexing as a ranking signal for all users on Android, regardless
> of whether they have your app installed or not. 
> 
> <footer class="blockquote-footer"> <cite>Lawrence Chang, Product Manager <a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2015/04/drive-app-installs-through-app-indexing.html">2015-04-16</a></cite></footer>
{: class="blockquote" cite="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2015/04/drive-app-installs-through-app-indexing.html"}

Signed-in users would likely see content from apps they have
installed. ([App Indexing](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6041489?hl=en) allows
Google to surface this information in search results)

> Starting today, we will begin to use information from indexed apps
> as a factor in ranking for signed-in users who have the app
> installed. As a result, we may now surface content from indexed apps
> more prominently in search. To find out how to implement App
> Indexing, which allows us to surface this information in search
> results

{: class="blockquote" cite="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2015/02/finding-more-mobile-friendly-search.html"}


### Crawling

Crawling rate is not a ranking signal.

> Google uses hundreds of signals to rank the results, and while
> crawling is necessary for being in the results, it's not a ranking
> signal.
> 
> <footer class="blockquote-footer"> <cite>Gary Illyes: Crawling and Indexing teams at What Crawl Budget Means for Googlebot <a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2017/01/what-crawl-budget-means-for-googlebot.html">2017-01-16</a></cite></footer>
{: class="blockquote" cite="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2017/01/what-crawl-budget-means-for-googlebot.html"}


### HTTPS

HTTPS is a ranking signal and is better than HTTP.

> over the past few months we’ve been running tests taking into
> account whether sites use secure, encrypted connections as a signal in
> our search ranking algorithms. We've seen positive results, so
> we're starting to use HTTPS as a ranking signal. For now it's only a
> very lightweight signal — affecting fewer than 1% of global queries,
> and carrying less weight than other signals such as high-quality
> content — while we give webmasters time to switch to HTTPS. But over
> time, we may decide to strengthen it, because we’d like to encourage
> all website owners to switch from HTTP to HTTPS to keep everyone
> safe on the web.

### Images

> Google potentially use EXIF data from pictures as a ranking factor
> <footer class="blockquote-footer"> <cite>Matt Cutts answer to Does Google use EXIF data from pictures as a ranking factor? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=GMf6FmRus2M">2014-02-14</a></cite></footer>
{: class="blockquote" cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=GMf6FmRus2M"}

### Inbound Links

Links from other websites should be gained through:

- merit-based and
- freely-volunteered 
- relevant to geographic location

> Inbound links are links from pages on external sites linking back to
> your site. Inbound links can bring new users to your site, and when
> the links are merit-based and freely-volunteered as an editorial
> choice, they're also one of the positive signals to Google about
> your site's importance. Other signals include things like our
> analysis of your site's content, its relevance to a geographic
> location, etc
>

{: class="blockquote" cite="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2008/10/good-times-with-inbound-links.html"}


### Search Query

Search query intent is favored over a mobile friendly site, i.e.: a
non mobile-friendly site with better content than a mobile friendly
one with less relevant content will be preferred.

> the intent of the search query is still a very strong signal — so
> even if a page with high quality content is not mobile-friendly, it
> could still rank well if it has great, relevant content.

{: class="blockquote" cite="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2016/03/continuing-to-make-web-more-mobile.html"}

### Metadata

Google does not use the keywords meta tag in web ranking

> At least for Google's web search results currently (September 2009),
> the answer is no. Google doesn't use the "keywords" meta tag in our
> web search ranking. 
>

{: class="blockquote" cite="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2009/09/google-does-not-use-keywords-meta-tag.html"}

### Mobile

Mobile friendly contribute to a positive ranking.

> To keep search results uncluttered, we’ll be removing the label,
> although the mobile-friendly criteria will continue to be a ranking
> signal.

Mobile friendly websites are boosted on mobile search results.

> As we noted earlier this year, today’s the day we begin globally
> rolling out our mobile-friendly update. We’re boosting the ranking
> of mobile-friendly pages on mobile search results. Now searchers can
> more easily find high-quality and relevant results where text is
> readable without tapping or zooming, tap targets are spaced
> appropriately, and the page avoids unplayable content or horizontal
> scrolling.

{: class="blockquote" cite="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2015/04/rolling-out-mobile-friendly-update.html"}

> Last year, we started using mobile-friendliness as a ranking signal

> we’ll start rolling out an update to mobile search results that
> increases the effect of the ranking signal to help our users find
> even more pages that are relevant and mobile-friendly.

Mobile-friendly websites are more likely to appear in search results
over other non-mobile friendly sites with similar content.

> Starting April 21, we will be expanding our use of
> mobile-friendliness as a ranking signal. This change will affect
> mobile searches in all languages worldwide and will have a
> significant impact in our search results. Consequently, users will
> find it easier to get relevant, high quality search results that are
> optimized for their devices.

### Social

Google +1 button amount of shares may increase web pages ranking.

> We’ll add +1 buttons to search results and ads on Google.com. We’ll
> also start to look at +1’s as one of the many signals we use to
> determine a page’s relevance and ranking, including social signals
> from other services. For +1's, as with any new ranking signal, we'll
> be starting carefully and learning how those signals affect search
> quality over time.

> <footer class="blockquote-footer"> <cite>David Byttow, Software Engineer, +1 Button <a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2011/03/introducing-1-button.html">2011-03-08</a></cite></footer>
{: class="blockquote" cite="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2011/03/introducing-1-button.html"}


### Speed

Site speed is a ranking signal, fast loading websites are preferred.

> You may have heard that here at Google we're obsessed with speed, in
> our products and on the web. As part of that effort, today we're
> including a new signal in our search ranking algorithms: site
> speed. Site speed reflects how quickly a website responds to web
> requests.
> 
> <footer class="blockquote-footer"> <cite>Amit Singhal, Google Fellow and Matt Cutts, Principal Engineer, Google Search Quality Team <a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2010/04/using-site-speed-in-web-search-ranking.html">2010-04-09</a></cite></footer>
{: class="blockquote" cite="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2010/04/using-site-speed-in-web-search-ranking.html"}

Why is speed important to Google? Websites with fast loading times
are good to:

- internet users, improving user experience while browsing
- reduces operating costs

> Faster sites create happy users and we've seen in our internal
> studies that when a site responds slowly, visitors spend less time
> there. But faster sites don't just improve user experience; recent
> data shows that improving site speed also reduces operating costs.
