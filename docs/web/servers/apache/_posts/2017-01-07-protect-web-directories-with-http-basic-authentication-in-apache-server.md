## Overview

HTTP Basic Auth is very common in the web, although it is not the most
secure one. 

It's simplicity makes it a simple choice to add a layer of security to
web directory quickly, not needing *sessions* nor *cookies*.

## Concepts

HTTP Basic authentication needs that a client provides a username
and password when making a request.

## Steps to secure a directory

To use HTTP Basic Authentication on a server, you need to create two files
 
- `.htaccess`: specifies which directory to protect
- `.htpasswd`: passwords file

The each time you access the directory of `.htaccess` it asks for
*username* and *password* validating it against `.htpasswd`
credentials.

We will end up having this directories structure:

~~~
/home
	/secure
		/apasswords
...
/var
	/www
		/myprotected
			.htaccess
~~~

### Create Apache .htaccess

Add an `.htaccess` file inside each directory that will be protected
with the following content, in this case in `/var/www/myprotected/.htaccess`:

~~~
AuthType Basic
AuthName "Restricted Access"
AuthUserFile /home/secure/apasswords
Require valid-user
~~~

### Create Apache passwords file

Create a directory **outside apache document root**, only Apache should
access the password file.


<pre class="shell">
<samp>
<span class="shell-prompt">$</span> <kbd>mkdir -p /home/secure/</kbd>
<span class="shell-prompt">$</span> <kbd>chmod 0660 /home/secure/apasswords</kbd>
<span class="shell-comment"># Create password file with user foobar</span>
<span class="shell-prompt">$</span> <kbd>htpasswd -c /home/secure/apasswords foobar</kbd>
<span class="shell-comment"># In this case the server user and group is www-data</span>
<span class="shell-prompt">$</span> <kbd>chown www-data:www-data /home/secure/apasswords</kbd>
</samp>
</pre>

/home/secure/apasswords must be only readable by Apache web server
{: class="alert alert-info"}

The `mkdir -p` creates all the folder structure specified in the
parameters
{: class="alert alert-info"}

### To add more users

To change or add more users of the file, the same command can be used
without the `-c` option, to add the user `john`.

<pre class="shell">
<samp>
<span class="shell-prompt">$</span> <kbd>htpasswd .htpasswd john</kbd>

</samp>
</pre>


## Risks

The HTTP Basic authentication has several issues that makes it
insecure in some scenarios, the standard itself states:

> This scheme is not considered to be a secure method of user
> authentication unless used in conjunction with some external secure
> system such as TLS (Transport Layer Security, [RFC5246]), as the
> user-id and password are passed over the network as cleartext.

|------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------|
| HTTP Basic auth issue  | Insecurity issue                                            |
|:----------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------:|
| Password is sent in base64 encoding | Password can be converted to plaintext *(solved by using [Secure Sockets Layer])* |
| Password is sent for each request   | Larger attack window |
| The password is cached by the webbrowser | Can be reused by any other request to the server, e.g. [CSRF] |
| The password may be stored permanently in the browser | [CSRF] and it might be stolen by another user on a shared machine |
