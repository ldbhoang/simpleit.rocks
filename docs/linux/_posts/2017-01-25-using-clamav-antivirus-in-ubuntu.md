## Overview

There are viruses for all platforms, they are just more common on
Windows. 

Having an antivirus in Linux is just another tool to help you protect
the system, you won't be entirely safe just using it, you also need
safe practices.

We will install *ClamAV*, one of the most popular antivirus software
for Linux.

> ClamAVÂ® is an open source antivirus engine for detecting trojans,
> viruses, malware & other malicious threats.

## Why do we need antivirus in Linux

My choice is to have an antivirus to run from time to time or at
suspicious files and folders, but **not having it running as
daemon** to avoid a performance decrease in the system.

## Install

To install we use the *clamav* package:

<pre class="shell">
<samp>
<span class="shell-prompt">#</span> <kbd>apt-get install clamav</kbd>

</pre>

### Update db

Now we need to update the signatures so we have our virus database
updated with `freshclam`.

<pre class="shell">
<samp>
<span class="shell-prompt">#</span> <kbd>freshclam</kbd>

</samp>
</pre>

## Scan commands

To scan a directory recursively we use `-r` and `-i` to just display
the infected files.

<pre class="shell">
<samp>
<span class="shell-prompt">$</span> <kbd>clamscan -r --bell -i ~/Downloads/</kbd>

## Other notes

Some other good security recommendations: 

- keep software updated
- beware phishing sites (browsing through web pages that looks like
  another popular ones)
- analyze command before running them or use trusted sources.
