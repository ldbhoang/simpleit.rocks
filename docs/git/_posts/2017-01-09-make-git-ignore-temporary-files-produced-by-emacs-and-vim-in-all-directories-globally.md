description: Ignore backup files produced by VIm and Emacs in all your git projects
layout: post

## Overview

Using VIm and [Emacs] on a daily basis is very common for programmers.

They have recovering systems to avoid losing work if a computer
crashes, that would make your directories full of strange files ending
in `~`, swap files (`.swp`) or backup files named like `#<filename>#`.

Those files would appear from time to time in your <kbd>git
status</kbd> listings that wouldn't add any valuable information.

Better than disabling them, is to avoid seeing them globally, so any new
`git` repository won't show them in the `status` of changed file list
but you will still be able to recover them if anything bad happens
while editing.

## Enabling gitignore globally

We will set up a global `.gitignore_global` file, i.e.: a list of rules for
ignoring files in every *Git* repository on the computer.

<pre class="shell">
<samp>
<span class="shell-prompt">$</span> <kbd>git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global</kbd>

</samp>
</pre>

This command will automatically set the following configuration in
your [`~/.gitconfig_global`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#git-config-gitconfig) file.

~~~
[core]
        excludesfile = /home/user/.gitignore_global
~~~


> Patterns which a user wants Git to ignore in all situations (e.g.,
> backup or temporary files generated by the user’s editor of choice)
> generally go into a file specified by core.excludesFile in the user’s
> ~/.gitconfig. Its default value is $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore. If
> $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is either not set or empty, $HOME/.config/git/ignore
> is used instead.

## gitignore 

Github has a great project with useful `.gitignore` files
optimized for a Operating System and editor specific.

We grab the ones for Emacs and Vim (I don't think you ever need any
other editor ;)

You should put them together in a single `~/.gitignore_global` file
that will be processed globally.

### gitignore for Emacs

[Gitignore for Emacs](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Global/Emacs.gitignore) editor:

~~~
# -*- mode: gitignore; -*-
*~
\#*\#
/.emacs.desktop
/.emacs.desktop.lock
*.elc
auto-save-list
tramp
.\#*

# Org-mode
.org-id-locations
*_archive

# flymake-mode
*_flymake.*

# eshell files
/eshell/history
/eshell/lastdir

# elpa packages
/elpa/

# reftex files
*.rel

# AUCTeX auto folder
/auto/

# cask packages
.cask/
dist/

# Flycheck
flycheck_*.el

# server auth directory
/server/

# projectiles files
.projectile

# directory configuration
.dir-locals.el
~~~

### gitignore for Vim

[Gitignore for Vim](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Global/Vim.gitignore) editor:

~~~
# swap
[._]*.s[a-v][a-z]
[._]*.sw[a-p]
[._]s[a-v][a-z]
[._]sw[a-p]
# session
Session.vim
# temporary
.netrwhist
*~
# auto-generated tag files
tags
~~~

## Other global gitignore properties

 Other common .gitignore configurations are also available in
 Github's [gist](https://gist.github.com/octocat/9257657) that may
 worth adding them to the global gitignore file.

## Conclusion

Now every time you work in a new or old project you won't have to deal
with any backup files automatically generated by Vim or Emacs.
