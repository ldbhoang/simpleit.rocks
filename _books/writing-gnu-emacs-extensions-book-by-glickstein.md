> GNU Emacs is more than an editor; it's a programming environment, a
> communications package, and many other things. To provide such a
> broad range of functions, it offers a full version of the Lisp
> programming language -- something much more powerful than the little
> macro languages provided in other editors (including older versions
> of Emacs). 
>
> GNU Emacs is a framework in which you can create whole
> new kinds of editors or just alter aspects of the many functions it
> already provides.In this book, Bob Glickstein delves deep into the
> features that permit far-reaching Emacs customizations. He teaches
> you the Lisp language and discusses Emacs topics (such as syntax
> tables and macro templates) in easy-to-digest portions. 
> 
> Examples
> progress in complexity from simple customizations to extensive major
> modes.You will learn how to write interactive commands, use hooks
> and advice, perform error recovery, manipulate windows, buffers, and
> keymaps, exploit and alter Emacs's main loop, and more. Each topic
> is explored through realistic examples and a series of successive
> refinements that illustrate not only the Emacs Lisp language, but
> the development process as well, making learning pleasant and
> natural.
