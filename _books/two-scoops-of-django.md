This book is an excellent approach for developers that already know a bit
of Django but want to take their knowledge to a new level.

It has plenty of examples, best practices and tips in a clear and relaxed
style, that makes it very easy to follow.

One of the best thing about this book is that __it can be used as a 
reference book, each chapter is independent from the previous others__.
You can tailor the reading to suit you.
