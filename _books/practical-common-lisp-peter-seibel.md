> This is the first book that introduces Lisp as a language for the real world.
> Practical Common Lisp presents a thorough introduction to Common Lisp,
> providing you with an overall understanding of the language features
> and how they work. Over a third of the book is devoted to practical
> examples such as the core of a spam filter and a web application for
> browsing MP3s and streaming them via the Shoutcast protocol to any
> standard MP3 client software (e.g., iTunes, XMMS, or WinAmp). In other
> "practical" chapters, author Peter Seibel demonstrates how to build a
> simple but flexible in-memory database, how to parse binary files, and
> how to build a unit test framework in 26 lines of code
